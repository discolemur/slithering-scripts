Annotation

-----scripts------

REQUIRED:
trinotate_minus_trinity.sh
    usage: trinotate_minus_trinity.sh input.fasta output.gff
    output: Trinotate output will be in a new directory called '$file.gff_tmp' where $file is the input file.

OPTIONAL:
produceTrinotateScripts.sh
    output: slurm scripts (to run trinotate_minus_trinity.sh) for each *.fasta file in the current directory.

-----tasks------

1) Run trinity (assumed beforehand)

2) Run trinotate shell script

    trinotate_minus_trinity.sh input.fasta output.gff

3) Find output in output.gff_tmp directory. (Yeah, it's a stupid naming system. I was a beginner when I did that. You can change it in the shell script.)

NOTE:
trinotate_minus_trinity.sh will not overwrite files that already exist.
    That means that you may need to delete incomplete files if the job fails. The
    good news is that it will start where it left off, saving your time.
