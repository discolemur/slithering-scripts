Ortholog Clusters

-----scripts------

REQUIRED:

clustering.py
    usage: clustering.py [-h] [--uses_dna] [-t T] organism_count output_type input
       Use the -h flag to be acquainted with how it works.
       The -t flag is to indicate how many processors to allocate.
    output: Aligned ortholog clusters with .aln extension in a new directory based on your arguments.

-----tasks------

1) Obtain multiparanoid output file (could be a solution.disco if you used my special multiparanoid solution)
    This is a tab-delimited file with three columns : clusterID   organism    gene
    I will refer to this as the disco file.

2) Be inside directory with organism.cds.fasta or organism.pep (from transdecoder output files) for each organism in disco file.

3) clustering.py [-h] [--uses_dna] [-t T] organism_count output_type disco_input
