Ortholog Clusters

-----scripts------

REQUIRED:

clustering.py
    usage: clustering.py [-h] [--uses_dna] [-t T] organism_count output_type input
       Use the -h flag to be acquainted with how it works.
       The -t flag is to indicate how many processors to allocate.
    output: Aligned ortholog clusters with .aln extension in a new directory based on your arguments.

-----tasks------

1) Obtain multiparanoid output file (could be a solution.disco if you used my special multiparanoid solution)
    This is a tab-delimited file with three columns : clusterID   organism    gene
    I will refer to this as the disco file.

2) Be inside directory with organism.fasta.transdecoder.cds or organism.pep (from transdecoder output files) for each organism in disco file.

3) clustering.py [-h] [--uses_dna] [-t T] organism_count output_type disco_input

4) Find output in the new directory (clustering.py should tell you where to look).
    Output clusters will have extension .aln because it is an alignment file.
    One of the programs we used (maybe hamstr?) used a .aln extension for its
    alignments, and I sort of adopted that nomenclature. You are free to change
    this, but know that it is an important part of my other scripts, so you would
    have to change those as well (to search for .fasta instead of .aln for instance.)
